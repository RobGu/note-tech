# Guide

## Subject

In format of *[project_name] Daily Report* , where *project_name* should be replaced by your project name, and, no need to put your name or date in the subject.

## Content

In this format:

```
Today:

- Item1
- Item2
- Item3

Next Day:

- Item1
- Item2
- Item3
```

- **The content should be well organized, not too concise nor too verbose.** The purpose of daily report is to report your progress to your leader, **including coding and researching, what have you done, what problems you have encountered, what solutions/workarounds you have came up with, and what are you planning to do next**, so your leader can act accordingly or help you in time. Think of this purpose before you send it out.
- Don't write it like a diary of events, don't put activities like push code, review code, merge code into it. State what matters.
- If you're describing a problem, attach enough context, what references you have read, what's the decision you have made.
- Use simple present tense with verbs, no need of *I did* or *I will* .
- Pay attention to writing, including spelling and punctuations.

A bad example, this is useless:

```
Today:

- Fix some bugs.

Next Day:

- Fix more bugs.
```

A good example:

```
Today:

- Draft db schema of xxx and xxx, see doc.
- Fix bug #11: xxx, #14: xxx.
- Try to fix bug #12: xxx, there is a bug of xxx library, my workaround is xxx, not sure if this is appropriate, please advise.
- Implement story #3: xxx, 70 percent done.
- Read book xxx chapter xxx, now I understand xxx.

Next Day:

- Draft db schema of xxx and xxx.
- Continue to fix bug #12: xxx with better solution.
- Finish story #3: xxx.
- Research xxx, find out why xxx.
```

NOTE: the `doc` and `#11`, `#14` etc are links, when you mention something, if they have external related resources, better to link them. On the contrast, just write *Fix bug #11* is not friendly, you're forcing your leader to manually navigate, which is a wast of time.
